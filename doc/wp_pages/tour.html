<h2>Brands</h2>
<div>
  <p>Your brand will mean different things to you that it might to us, so we're not forcing you to use BrandPulse a certain way.</p>
  <p>Here are some ways we use the tool and think might be helpful to you too.</p>
  <h4>You</h4>
  <p>You might be your brand.  If you're a solopreneur, independent contractor, independent consultant, media personality or bonafide celebrity versions of your name and various social media screen names would be good candidates in this category.</p>
  <h4>Your product</h4>
  <p>Your product might be your brand if you create something.  It might be more than one product, and that's fine with us.  We've set it up so you can keep track of your brands how you want, and group them and their queries as you need.</p>
  <h4>Your business</h4>
  <p>Your business might be your brand if you're a service provider.</p>

<h2>Team</h2>
<div>
  <p>Are you lucky enough to have a team, a partner or even a Virtual Assistant?  If so you'll love the team feature for keeping everyone on the same page and not duplicating work and effort.</p>

<h2>Workflow</h2>
<div>
  <p>We try to make it easy and quick for you to work.  We've set it up for how it works for us, and we think you'll like it, but of course, you can change it later.</p>
  <p>Here's how we do it.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>One of us logs in and goes through the search results in a quick first pass.</li>
    <li>During this first pass we'll mark items we want to follow up on.</li>
    <li>If we find something that strikes us as particularly positive or negative we'll flag it that way.</li>
    <li>If we have more time, we'll make another pass through the ones marked for follow up and take care of them.</li>
    <li>If we don't have time, we'll pick up with the items to follow up on during the next session, or the other member might take care of it.</li>
