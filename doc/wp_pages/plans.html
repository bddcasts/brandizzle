<h1>Start with a 30 Day Free Trial, <em>no Credit Card Required!</em></h1>
<h2>Let's keep it simple</h2>
<p>We dont want you to have to pull out your calculators to figure out which plan is the best value for you, so we're keeping it simple and starting out with just one plan.</p>
<p>We're confident that this will serve the needs of 80% of our customers.  If you think you're going to blow out of our starter plan we can talk.  Though we'd prefer to have the conversation <em>after your 30 day free trial</em>.
<h2>Starter Plan</h2>
<div>
  <p>What's included?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>6 Searches, split across however many brands you like</li>
    <li>2 team members, enough to get you (and if you're lucky) one other person connected to your tribe</li>
  <ul>
  <h3>for only $29/month</h3>
  <p><em>That's less than you'd spend on a networking lunch.</em></p>
</div>
<h2>Can BrandPulse keep you <em>better connected</em> to your customers in less time?</h2>
<div>
Yep, here's how:
<ul>
  <li>Define search terms that relate to your brand, it's quick and easy</li>
  <li>Search popular online and social media sources and bring them together in a single view</li>
  <li>Filter out, and narrow in, on the comments that are most important to your brand and business</li>
  <li>Take it in phases. Run through the results quickly to identify important ones. Then follow up when you have more time for thoughtful responses</li>
  <li>Share the work with your team</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>What's the deal with the free trials?</h2>
<p>It's easy, you sign up for the <strong>Starter Plan</strong> and start using BrandPulse <em>for free</em> for 30 days.  We hope that in those 30 days BrandPulse becomes a small part of your daily routine. <em>Because it's freed you up to do other, important things, like run your business</em>.
<p>No?  That's cool.  <em>Seriously!</em>  If you don't do anything, at the end of the trial you'll lose access to BrandPulse and you'll have our thanks for at least giving us a try.</p>
<p><strong>We're pretty sure that won't happen and you won't want to cancel</strong>.  And that's cool to, it's better than cool, it's <strong>awesome!</strong>. Since we're not collecting your credit card information when you sign up you'll need to go into your account preferences and enter a credit card for us to bill when the trial period is up.</p>
<p><strong>Forgot to enter your Credit Card information and the 30 day trial has ended?</strong> Again, no worries.  We'll keep your account around, you just won't be able to do much with it.  You will be able to login and get to your account/billing preferences to enter a credit card at that point.  Once we get payment we'll unlock your account and it'll be like it never missed a beat.</p>
<p>Oh, and you can cancel at any time.  Say the word and we'll not charge you again and you can use BrandPulse until your currently paid session runs out.</p>
