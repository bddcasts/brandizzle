<h2>Brands</h2>
<div>
  <p>Your brand will mean different things to you that it might to us, so we're not forcing you to use BrandPulse a certain way.</p>
  <h3>You</h3>
  <p>You might be your brand.  If you're a solopreneur, independent contractor, independent consultant, media personality or bonafide celebrity versions of your name and various social media screen names would be good candidates in this category.</p>
  <h3>Your product</h3>
  <p>Your product might be your brand if you create something.  It might be more than one product, and that's fine with us.  We've set it up so you can keep track of your brands how you want, and group them and their queries as you need.</p>
  <h3>Your business</h3>
  <p>Your business might be your brand if you're a service provider.</p>
