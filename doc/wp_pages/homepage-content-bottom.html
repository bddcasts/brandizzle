        <h4>Workflow</h4>
        <p>BrandPulse supports a couple different workflows, including one we think works pretty well. We suggest you do result triage, quickly scanning through your results and marking off ones that are interesting and need to be dealt with later.  Once you've triaged you can go back and batch the rest of them and take care of responding.</p>

        <h4>Teams</h4>
        <p>If you're lucky enough to have someone to work with, or you chose to outsource part of this work, the BrandPulse team feature is for you. Adding a member to your team lets them triage results and respond to the important ones.  Or they triage and you respond. Or vice versa.</p>

        <h4>All your results in one place</h4>
        <p>BrandPulse groups all your results into a single stream which is great for triage.</p>

        <h4>New services "just work"</h4>
        <p>A problem with the DIY monitoring tools is you have to create a search for every term, on every platform you want to search.  Not on BrandPulse.  You define your terms and group them by Brand once.  When we add a new service we'll instantly start searching it for the terms you've already defined.</p>
