<p>Imagine this...</p>
<p>Two girlfriends sitting in a coffee shop and suddenly the conversation turns to your product.  One raves and raves about it.  
  "But", she says, "I just couldn't figure out this one thing.  I posted something to twitter and facebook, and nothing.  I wish I could have figured it out, because it did everything else I needed."</p>
<p>Maybe you've heard a similar story yourself.  Hearing this one, you're probably screaming "no, no, no! It's
  this simple, I can explain that in 5 seconds."</p>
<p>If you knew about it, you could respond.  If you responded to this woman you would have converted her into a true fan, and she would have planted a very fertile seed in her friends mind about your product.</p>
