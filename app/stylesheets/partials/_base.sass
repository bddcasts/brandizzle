// Here is where you can define your constants for your application and to configure the blueprint framework.
// Feel free to delete these if you want keep the defaults:

!blueprint_grid_columns = 25
//!blueprint_container_size = 1000px
!blueprint_grid_width = 20px
!blueprint_grid_margin  = 20px

// Use this to calculate the width based on the total width.
// Or you can set !blueprint_grid_width to a fixed value and unset !blueprint_container_size -- it will be calculated for you.
//!blueprint_grid_width   = (!blueprint_container_size + !blueprint_grid_margin) / !blueprint_grid_columns - !blueprint_grid_margin

  :padding-left= !blueprint_grid_width * !n + (!blueprint_grid_margin * (!n - 1))
